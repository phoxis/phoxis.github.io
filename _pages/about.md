  I received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) in computer science from Calcutta University (CU), India, in 2011, the masterâ€™s degree in computer science from Banaras Hindu University (BHU), India, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland, in 2020. I worked in industry in 2015 for a couple of years as a software developer. After my PhD, I worked as a postdoctoral research fellow in Insight Centre for Data Analytics (UCD) during 2020 - 2021, and in VistaMilk Science Foundation Ireland Research Centers, UCD during 2021 - 2023. After that I joined UCD School of Computer Science as an Assistant Professor in 2023.
